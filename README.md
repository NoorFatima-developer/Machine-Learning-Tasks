# Machine Learning Tasks

**Task 1**

**Movie Genre Classification**
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot
summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as
Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines.

**Task 2**

**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, andexperiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
legitimate. Link of dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection

**Task 3**

**SMS Spam Detection**
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
